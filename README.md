## My Solution of Assignments of CS231n Winter2016
This is my solution of three assignments of CS231n Winter2016.
[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Winter2016](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/) is
a classical class, which teaches you to 
implement, train and debug your own neural networks via python package numpy on Cifar10 datasets
and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. 
******
**Note:** If you consult my code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, 
so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup.
